# Logical Clocks Presentation

This repository contains the slides for my presentation on Logical Clocks.

The raw slides can be found in [`slides.md`](https://github.com/Josso/logical-clocks-presentation/blob/master/slides.md) and a PDF-version can be found in [`logical-clocks.pdf`](https://github.com/Josso/logical-clocks-presentation/blob/master/logical-clocks.pdf).

Slides, information and images are based on the book “Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms” by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten van Steen, and the corresponding slides from Maarten van Steen’s course on Distributed Systems.

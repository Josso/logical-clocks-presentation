# Logical Clocks Presentation

This repository contains the slides for my presentation on Logical Clocks.

Slides, information and images are based on the book “Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms” by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten van Steen, and the corresponding slides from Maarten van Steen’s course on Distributed Systems.
